For as long as I've been a student of the humanities, I've had an affinity for
the postmodern. There's something inherently satisfying in the construction of
meta-narratives — ~~a sort of Sisyphean rebellion, to believe that every
story has been told and retold, and to retell it (if somewhat mockingly)
nonetheless.~~

> Il faut imaginer Sysyphe heureux.

I digress. This is a blog post about how this blog post was built.
